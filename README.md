# Blog API 
## Notes:
The app is using mongo, mongoose, express, nodemon.. The structure of this project follows Nate's way, it is easy to aollow and  understand, in case u need to create a basic api with nodejs,mongoose & express follow this. The app starts with server.js, checks app.use('/api', Router) goes to Router folder/index.js. Index.js manage router in this case author & post. Post goes to post-router and if ULR is '/' get all posts and so on.
## Setup
- fork and clone this repo
- npm install
- run `node seed.js` from the command line to setup your database (you'll need to have `mongod` running in the background)
-  to remove data from your database, run `mongo` from the command line, then `use blog-api`. run `db.posts.remove()` to remove all posts, or `db.authors.remove()` to remove all authors. You can always run `node seed.js` again to re-seed the database
- download [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) if you haven't already. It will be helpful for testing your api

## API Endpoints

- `/api/posts/sort/by-date` get all blog posts and order by date

## Bonuses
- refactor your routes to use express router
  - [Express Router Docs](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#router)
  - [Learn to Use Express Router](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4)
- Create a 'tag search' field. add an index.html file with a text input box. When you type something into the input box and hit 'Submit', your API should search all your posts for any posts that have a tag that matches the input text
-  create a 'text search' field. add an index.html file with a text input box. When you type something into the input box and hit 'Submit', your API should search all your posts' bodies for any posts that contain the search word anywhere in their body. In other words, if you type in 'JavaScript' your should get a response will all posts that contain the word 'JavaScript' anywhere in the body
